            Quantum entanglement

            In the same way, a particle formed from the decay of a larger particle has an indefinite spin, so the two particles generated have a superposition of spin up and spin down, we can only know the spin of the system.

                    The spin of a particle collapses into one state only when it is measured, and immediately, the spin of the "entangled" particle collapses to balance the spin of the system, no matter the distance.

            To find an answer to the entanglement phenomenon there were created two theories: 
            <br>
            <br>
            Einstein supported the idea that particles must have some “hidden variables” from which it is already determined what the spin of the particle will be when it's measured.
            <br>
            <br>
            Bohr and Feynman instead supported the idea that the wave of matter of a particle was the complete description of the system, therefore the “spooky action” must be a reality.

                    The last experiment was done in 1981, in this experiment a beam of calcium atoms was excited by a laser, this process released two entangled photons from the energetic jump of the electrons.

                    These photons were made pass throw a quartz crystal that, at random, would be excited to deviate the photons into a random oriented polarizer to detect the spin.

            The results violated Bell's theorem, so it implied that there were no hidden variables, but it was not completely proven:
            <br>
            <br>
            The first argument could be made by the superdeterminism theory: what if the random choice of the measurement influenced the photons?

            <br>
            The second one implies that the experiment demonstrated the absence of local hidden variables (in the particle), but there can be non local hidden variables (external of space-time).
