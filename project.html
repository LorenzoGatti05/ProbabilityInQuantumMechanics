            Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
        </h2>
        <div class="image">
            <div class="text">
        <h3>
            In 1927 Heisenberg devised a principle according to which it is impossible to simultaneously measure, with unlimited precision, position and momentum of a particle.
        </h3>
        <P>
            $$ t=e^mp $$
        </P>
        </div>
        <img src="image9.jpg" width="20%" height="20%">
        </div>
        <h3>
            This principle was derived from the roots of quantum mechanics, so in this field there is no way to get around it.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The key idea is that the components of the disequation, being uncertainties of the respective values, can be considered as gaussian functions.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The position uncertainty is the probability that arises from the square of schrodinger's equation.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Using the Fourier transform, we can get the uncertainty on the frequency of the wave of matter of the particle.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            These values respect an equation:
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Another key element for Heisemberg's principle is in the De Broglie phd thesis, in which he discovered that the momentum of a particle is equal to its frequency multiplied by planck's constant.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            With this formula we can partially obtain Heisemberg's uncertainty equations.

            Copenaghen interpretation
        </h2>
        <h3>
            This is the interpretation that Heisenberg had on this principle.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            With this interpretation it makes sense to talk about the position and momentum of an elementary particle only if an experiment is theorized to measure them.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            In fact, according to Heisemberg, it is the interaction between the particle and the measuring instrument that creates the values themself.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Furthermore, Heisemberg explained how measuring one value of the particle, alters in an unpredictable way the other one.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            An elementary particle position is measured with a beam of light.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Light has different wavelengths, the shorter the wavelength, the more energetic the light is.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            To measure with a great degree of precision a particle, we need to use light with a very short wavelength, but this means that we give a lot of energy to the particle itself, alterating its momentum in an unpredictable way.

            Stern-Gerlach experiment
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Stern and Gerlach conceived an experiment using two magnets, creating a magnetic field.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            In this field, if you shoot magnets in a straight line with a given orientation, they bend the trajectory in relation to their initial orientation.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The experiment consisted in shooting electrons in this magnetic field, to verify if they behaved like magnets would have done.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The results were unexpected, in fact the electrons went only in two directions, up or down.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            So, if one direction is taken in which the spin is measured, the spin can only take two values.
            <br>
            With this experiment we can also measure the value of the spin, shooting different types of particles in the magnetic field, and the bands that are formed are at defined distances. so the spin is quantized in units of h-bar.

            Bosons are the mediator of forces and interaction between particles and obey the Bose-Einstein statistic, so they have integer spin.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fermions make up matter and obey the fermi-dirac statistic, so they have half-odd-integer spin and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.
        </h3>

            Pauli's exclusion principle says that there can't be two fermions in the same quantistic state.

            Quantum superposition 
        </h2>
        <h3>
            A particle exists in the quantum world as a superposition of states, that collapses in one particular state whenever it is observed.
            <br>
            This is caused by the wave nature of the particles.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Different states of the particle generate different waves, which can be observed with interference phenomena.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            An experiment that allows this is the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which consists of a laser, two half-reflective mirrors, two fully-reflective mirrors and two particle detectors.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The experiment consists of splitting the wave function of a single photon in two using the semi-reflective mirror, a state in which it is reflected and one in which it has passed through the mirror.
            <br>
            Then the two waves are redirected towards the second semi-reflective  mirror using the two fully reflective mirrors, which divide the two waves into four.
            <br>
            The two detectors are placed on both sides of the last mirror.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            If the mirrors are well positioned we can observe an interference phenomenon between the wave that passes through the first mirror and the one that is reflected in one of the two detectors: we never detect the particle.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            If one of the two possible paths is blocked, then we see no interference and there is a 50/50 chance of detecting the particle on a given detector.

            Stern-Gerlach verifies Heisemberg's uncertainty principle and quantum superposition

        <h3>
            Using the Stern-Gerlach experiment we can prove that changing the order of measurements changes the outcome.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            If we do the experiment on the vertical axis, we obtain two beams, one with spin up and one with spin down. 
            <br>
            If then we take the beam with spin up and do with it another measurement on the vertical axis, we obtain only one beam, that has spin up.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            If we take the beam with spin up after the first measure and we measure it on the horizontal axis instead, we obtain two beams, one with spin left and the other one with spin right.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            If then we take the beam with spin left and do another measurement on the vertical axis, we obtain two beams, one with spin up and the other with spin down.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            This both proves that electrons's spin is a superposition of different spins, and that changing the order of the experiments, changes the outcome.

        <h3>

            Bohr and Feynman instead supported the idea that the wave of matter of a particle was the complete description of the system, therefore the “spooky action” must be a reality.

            Nobel prize 2022

            The debate isn't still settled, but in 2022 Clauser, Aspect and Zeilinger won the nobel prize:
            <br>
            Clauser and Aspect won it for finding strong evidence to question the “hidden variable” theory, Zeilinger instead found applications for the discoveries made in the experiments.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The starting point was Bell's theorem, which affirmed there were different probability values if the particles had “hidden variables” or if the properties of the particle were created at the moment of the observation.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The last experiment was done in 1981, in this experiment a beam of calcium atoms was excited by a laser, this process released two entangled photons from the energetic jump of the electrons.
            <br>
            These photons were made pass throw a quartz crystal that, at random, would be excited to deviate the photons into a random oriented polarizer to detect the spin.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The results violated Bell's theorem, so it implied that there were no hidden variables, but it was not completely proven:
            <br>
            <br>
            The first argument could be made by the superdeterminism theory: what if the random choice of the measurement influenced the photons?
            <br>
            <br>
            The second one implies that the experiment demonstrated the absence of local hidden variables (in the particle), but there can be non local hidden variables (external of space-time).
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Zeilinger demonstrated quantum teleportation, in which two particles, both entangled with a third one, can switch quantum states.
            <br>
            This discovery is the foundation for quantum computers, that use entanglement for a variety of processes.
            <br>
            He also contributed to advances in quantum cryptography and quantum computing.
